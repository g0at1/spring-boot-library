# Java Spring Library Project

## Description
The Java Spring Library Project is an ongoing project that aims to develop a library management system using the Spring framework. This project leverages the power and flexibility of Spring to create a scalable and efficient system for managing books, borrowers, and library transactions. Please note that this project is still a work in progress, and certain features and functionalities are yet to be implemented.

## Features (Planned)
- CRUD operations for books, borrowers, and library transactions.
- Book search and filtering capabilities.
- Borrowing and returning books.
- Fine calculation for overdue books.
- Authentication and authorization for librarian and borrower roles.
- Integration with an external database for persistent storage.
- RESTful API endpoints for programmatic access.

## Installation
1. Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) and Maven installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.
3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file (if applicable) to a directory of your choice.

## Development Setup
1. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
2. Configure the project dependencies and build path according to your IDE's guidelines.
3. Set up the database connection and configuration in the project's configuration files.
4. Implement and test the desired features and functionalities according to your project requirements.

## Usage
1. Build the project using Maven by running the following command in the project's root directory:
